/**
 * Runbook: Add Neighborhoods to Production Database
 * 
 * This script safely adds new neighborhoods to the production database.
 * It includes safety checks and rollback capabilities.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * 1. Set environment variables for production database
 * 2. Review the neighborhoods to be added in the NEIGHBORHOODS_TO_ADD array
 * 3. Run: npx ts-node src/runbook/add-neighborhoods.ts
 * 
 * Safety Features:
 * - Dry run mode to preview changes
 * - Duplicate detection
 * - Transaction rollback on errors
 * - Detailed logging
